To run, open in IntelliJ IDEA, or Gradle.

In the browser, visit `localhost:8080` (home page)
Add `/hello/<your name>` to receive a custom greeting
Add `/capitalize/<word>` to see that word in all capital letters
Add `/albums` to view information about a few of my favorite albums

Special thanks to Joshua Frazer for helping me keep my controller 'skinny'
